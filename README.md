# EXP 5: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROMPTING PATTERNS AND EXPLAIN WITH VARIOUS TEST SCENARIOS


# Aim:
To systematically evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different prompting patterns—such as zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought, role-based, and ReAct prompting—by testing them across diverse question types. The goal is to analyze the quality, accuracy, and depth of responses generated by multiple AI tools (e.g., Claude, Perplexity) and determine how different prompt styles influence the outcome.

# Questions – 1:
Is 97 a prime number?
# ChatGPT:
Yes, 97 is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. When checking for divisibility, 97 cannot be evenly divided by any number other than 1 and 97. It is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 (the primes less than √97 ≈ 9.8), which confirms that 97 is a prime.

# Claude:
Yes. A prime number has exactly two factors: 1 and itself. Since 97 is only divisible by 1 and 97, it is prime.

# Perplexity:
To determine if 97 is prime, I need to check if it's divisible by any number other than 1 and itself.

First, I'll check for divisibility by small primes: 97 ÷ 2 = 48.5 (not divisible by 2) 97 ÷ 3 = 32.33... (not divisible by 3) 97 ÷ 5 = 19.4 (not divisible by 5) 97 ÷ 7 = 13.85... (not divisible by 7) I only need to check divisibility up to √97 ≈ 9.85, so I'll check a few more numbers: 97 ÷ 11 = 8.81... (not divisible by 11) Since 11² > 97, I've verified that 97 has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 97 is a prime number.

# Question 2:
 Write a short poem about train.

# ChatGPT:
Rushing rails and smoky skies, A whistle blows, the engine flies. Through fields and towns it speeds along, A steel-bound thread, so bold and strong. Windows frame the world in flight, Day to dusk, and into night. The train rolls on, a restless stream— Carrying hopes, and every dream.


# Perplexity:
Steel serpent on silver track, Whistles echo, never look back. Windows flicker, stories pass by— Dreams in motion, under the sky.

# Claud:
Windows frame the world in flight, Day to dusk, and into night. The train rolls on, a restless stream— Carrying hopes, and every dream.

# Question 3:
Write a Python Program to add String

Chatgpt:
string1 = input("Enter the first string: ") string2 = input("Enter the second string: ")

result = string1 + string2

print("Concatenated string:", result) Explanation:

input("Enter the first string: ") o This line asks the user to type something. o Whatever the user types is read as a string and stored in the variable string1.
input("Enter the second string: ") o Same as above, this takes the second input from the user and stores it in string2.
result = string1 + string2 o The + operator is used to concatenate (join) the two strings. o For example, if string1 = "Hello" and string2 = "World", then result = "HelloWorld".
print("Concatenated string:", result) o This line prints out the final combined string.
Perpexlity:
string1 = input("Enter the first string: ") string2 = input("Enter the second string: ") result = string1 + string2

print("The concatenated string is:", result)

# Explanation:

• input() takes strings from the user.

• Using + between two strings joins (concatenates) them.

• print() displays the combined string

# Question 4:
Is it cheaper to take a train or flight from kolkata to china?

# Chatgpt:
Flights: • Cheapest flights from Kolkata (CCU) to cities like Kunming, Guangzhou, or Beijing typically start from ₹25,000 to ₹40,000 (round trip), depending on the season, airline, and how early you book. • Time: Around 3–6 hours with direct or one-stop flights. • Convenience: Super easy and fast, but more expensive. Train: • There’s no direct international train from Kolkata to China. • The theoretical land route would be: Kolkata → Northeast India → Myanmar (or via Nepal) → China. But this isn't practical — no continuous railway exists, and visa/travel restrictions make it super complicated. • Even if somehow possible, it would take several days, require multiple transfers, and cost way more than expected — including border permits, accommodation, and local travel. conclusion: Taking a flight is far cheaper, faster, and more practical. A land journey might sound adventurous, but it’s not feasible for most people.

# Perpexlity:
It is generally cheaper to fly from Kolkata to China than to take a train. The cheapest flights from Kolkata to various destinations in China start around ₹11,678 to ₹12,955 for one-way tickets, depending on the city and airline 24. Flight durations range roughly from 6.5 hours to over 20 hours with stops, and fares vary by season and airline, with the cheapest months typically around July and August 23.

In contrast, train travel from Kolkata to China is not commonly used or practical for most travelers, and available information indicates flying is both the cheapest and fastest option. For example, the cheapest way to get from Kolkata to China is by flight costing approximately ¥1200 - ¥2500 (roughly ₹13,000 to ₹27,000) and taking about 11.5 hours. Therefore, flights offer a more affordable and time-efficient means of travel from Kolkata to China compared to train options.

# Detailed Performance Breakdown:
Quality o Claude consistently provided the highest quality answers across various types of questions, with ChatGPT coming close behind. Perplexity, while still good, was less polished in comparison, especially for more complex or creative questions.
Accuracy o All AI tools performed exceptionally well in terms of accuracy, with Claude and Perplexity showing very consistent factual correctness. ChatGPT was equally accurate, particularly in terms of logic and factual delivery.
Depth o Claude again emerged as the leader in providing depth, especially for historical, philosophical, and complex comparative questions. ChatGPT came second, offering solid answers with a good level of 3 detail. Perplexity sometimes fell short on providing nuanced explanations, especially in creative or analytical questions.

# Key Insights:
• Claude demonstrated the best performance overall, particularly for tasks requiring depth,contextual understanding, and multi-faceted analysis. • ChatGPT was reliable for providing clear, structured, and accurate answers, making it ideal for general-purpose tasks and quick explanations. • Perplexity excelled in terms of factual accuracy but was less effective in tackling complex questions that required detailed elaboration or creative thought.

# Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, Claude is the most well-rounded tool for diverse, in-depth tasks, while ChatGPT provides a strong, general-purpose option for both creative and factual responses.Perplexity is optimal for straightforward factual inquiries, but may lack the richness and nuanceseen in other tools.
